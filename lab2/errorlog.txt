ERRORLOG:

compile 1: Shows arguments. forgot 'int' after 'i' in for loop.

compile 2: does not print "END OF PROGRAM" at end. Everything else runs fine.

compile 3: Change to accept no less than 3 args. works smoothly.

compile 4: Change to manipulate args. Missed an endl. output not pretty. Irrelevant. If words added, ato? gives 0.

compile 5: Change to check if argv[] is actually argv[][] for error checking. This is true.

compile 6: Attempt to use argv[][] as error check. Always throws error.

compile 7: Problem was comparing argv[][] to '0' to '9' using series of '||'. Comparing against ACII value works.

compile 8: Added switch, extra error catching. First full calculator with multiply, divide, add, subtract. Typo "arg[][]" in switch statement.

compile 9: Runs fine. Forgot break statement so inadvertently checked all switch statements. All run as expected.

compile 10: Removed debug CHECKING AGAINST line. All error handling aborts program as expected. Complete.

QUESTIONS

1) the name of the program is first. in my case, either ./a.out or ./calc

2) the last object in the array of c strings is the last item entered as a command-line argument.

3) the default of ato?, as seen in compile version 4, is '0'. I added a check so that it throws an error before it reaches the ato? function.

4) My program handles + , - , x , / and for funsies, and escaped \ written as \\
