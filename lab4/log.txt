Fixed the stack to make it work. Ran teststack.cpp to check.

Tried setting up the prompt, bugchecking through cout instead of stack.

cin DOES NOT WORK. Cannot set bits to end bit or failbit.

Using cstring library to parse using strtok and compare against operators with strcmp.

So much easier.

Set up rest of operands after checking single process works.

Quit does not quit when a floating point number (2.5) is in the stack.

Turns out the destructor was still set to int and was running into trouble with the floating
point numbers.

Calculator now runs properly.
