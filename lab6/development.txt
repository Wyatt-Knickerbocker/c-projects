Design
----------

The program will take exactly two command-line arguments, in the order "in-file" and "out-file".

It will print help if no arguments (i.e. argv == 1) are included, and will inform the user on what to do.

It will check to see if the in-file exists, and if the out-file exists.

It will throw an error if there is no in-file and abort the program.

It will ask the user if they wish to continue if the out-file exists, warning of over-write.

It will then read in the information from the in-file into an array delared size 100.

It will pass that array onto a function that will calculate the MIN, MAX, and AVG of the data.

It will take the AVG and pass it into the STD DEV function to calculate the standard deviation.

During this time, the program will print its progress to the screen.

When it is done, the program will alert the user and finish successfully.

Programming log
---------------

The hardest part of this program was to figure out the FILE * and how to read and write information,
which I did in other, seperate programs. Once I got the hang of it, it was pretty simple.

I did have a problem with my error catching, as I had set my if statement against

(argv !=3 || argv != 1)

and this always threw up a run-time error due to how the logic works. Once I figured it out, it became

(argv != 3 && argv !=1)

and the rest of the program went smoothly.
